<h1>Adobe Illustrator</h1>
<p>Here we will talk about computer graphics 2 where you'll be using adobe illustrator which is similar to adobe photoshop but also different. So in this class you do more complex prejects where as in graphics 1 you mainly work with pictures. In this classs you learn to make things out of words and do all sorts of things, definitely a lot more than the first class. This class is gonna challenge you and it's not the easiest stuff to do, but it's honestly a fun class.</p>

<p>This class will really improve your digital arts skill. You will learn how to use even more tools, and learn how to do so much more with the tools provided. With this being the end of the class there isn't much more to say about the classes, other than they're pretty cool and fun classes and you should definitely take them.</p>
